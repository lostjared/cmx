C++ Lexer written by Jared Bruni, in this project it will be used for 
a simple DSL for loading text based mxmap files produced by MXLevelEdit.

the application which tests the parser will take a level exported to text
format by MXLevelEdit and parse and display the tokens or change the
variable names and output to a text file. Run the program on the text
file again and it will parse correctly.

command line arguments:

-c input file
-f output shorthand variable names

example:

$ ./parseTest -c input.txt -f output.txt

or

$ ./parseTest -c input.txt
