make sure you have libtool, autoheader autoconf and automake installed
enter the directory and:

$ ./autogen.sh

also you should run

$ libtoolize

on my Mac with MacPorts its

$ glibtoolize

To configure this project using the generic module use:

$ ./configure --prefix=path platform=generic

path is where you compiled libpng libz SDL / boost:
sometimes /usr/local or /opt/local

to compile the windows module use:

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/mingw platform=windows --target=i386-mingw32 --host=i386-mingw32

for i386-mingw32 use what you named mingw32
It requires at least DirectX8 mingw headers/libs google for them.

For PS3 have PSL1GHT and the open source toolchain, enter main directory
If your using OS X Snow Leopard theres a prebuilt toolchain that works
with this version of CMX. Download @: http://lostsidedead.biz/ps3

$ make build_test

will copy headers and libs 
will compile test programs

for the pkg of a test program

$ make pkg

The generic module uses boost, so be sure to have it installed.
